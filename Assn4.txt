HEAPS 
It is also called a priority queue.A heap is a tree-based data structure in which all the nodes of the tree are 
in a specific order.For example, if X is the parent node of Y , then the value of X follows a specific order with respect to 
the value of Y and the same order will be followed across the tree.
The maximum number of children of a node in a heap depends on the type of heap. However, in the more commonly-used heap 
type, there are at most 2 children of a node and it's known as a Binary heap.
In binary heap, if the heap is a complete binary tree with N nodes, then it has smallest possible height which is log2N .
Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
->Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children.
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
->Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children.
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Heaps are used in many famous algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path, the heap sort 
sorting algorithm, implementing priority queues, and more.
