IMPLEMENTING QUEUE USING STACK

A queue is a linear data structure which follows the principle of FIFO(First in First out).
It can be implmented using stacks by using 2 stacks. The operations enqueue() and dequeue() are used in this process.
The stacks can be made to store information in two ways a) Making enqueue operation costly 
							b) Making dequeue opertaion costly
First stack(s1) is the main stack being used to store the data.
While the second stack(s2) is to assist and store data temporarily during various operations.
If the queue is empty, the first ele is pushed into the empty stack s1.
If s1 is not empty, the move all the elements of s1 into stack s2 , element by element.
Then add the new element to the stack s1 and shift all the data from s2 back into s1, element by element.
This maintains the correct order of elements such that the new element is at the bottom of the stack.
it looks like this at the end:
		1 -> 2 -> ...... -> new_ele 

APPLICATIONS OF STACKS AND QUEUES

Stacks can be used for :
	-> To reverse a string 
	->Used as 'undo mechanism' in text editors
	->it is used in lagnuage processing 
		->space for parameters and local variables is created internally using a stack.
		->compiler's syntax check for matching braces is implemented by using stack.
		->support for recursion
Queue is used for:
	->Depth First search and Breadth First Search Mechanism
	->Arithmetic expression evaluation (postfix to infix or vice versa)
